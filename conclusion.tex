Since these transistor counts are currently in the same range as a complete \ac{SoC}, it is not deemed probable that the suggested substrate is employed in smartphones with the current state of \ac{CMOS} technology unless only a very small implementation is necessary. Efficient inference in larger scale deployment such as in datacenters, the suggested substrate is deemed effective however.
